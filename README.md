Abstract:
Deciding which fruits to eat, and when, are key decisions made by frugivores, with implications for seed dispersal and other ecosystem services. It has long been hypothesized that fruit traits, including colour, odour and hardness, have been shaped by selective pressures from different guilds of frugivores, e.g. birds versus mammals. Yet there is little understanding about the extent to which suites of traits are correlated across ripening trajectories in fruits with different putative dispersal syndromes. We predicted visual traits to be more reliably tied to changes in sugar content in the bird-consumed fruit, and odour and hardness traits to be correlated to changes in sugar content in the mammal-consumed fruits. We measured changes in colour, odour, and hardness traits across ripeness stages in n = 100 bananas (Musa acuminata) and n = 160 mangoes (Mangifera indica), two bigger, climacteric fruits as models of mammal-dispersed fruits, and in n = 80 black currants (Ribes nigrum), a small, non-climacteric berry as model for bird-dispersed fruit. We quantified changes in fruit colour using image analysis, odour using a diversity index of volatile organic compounds sampled with solid-phase microextraction–gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, hardness using a mechanical tester, and sugar content using a digital refractometer. Bananas and mangoes tend to get darker, softer, and display changes in odour complexity as they get sweeter. Currants get darker, more chromatically conspicuous, softer, and less odiferous as they become sweeter. Our results demonstrate some similarities and some differences in fruit trait correlations among plant species that suggest possible links with different dispersal syndromes, as well as “reliable” traits that cut across dispersal syndromes. We suggest several hypotheses that future studies incorporating a large and phylogenetically-controlled dataset could tackle. Our study provides new methods and data on the interrelatedness of fruit traits, and contributes to the understanding of fruiting plant signal evolution and plant-animal interactions.
